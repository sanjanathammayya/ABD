When reading The Silly Chicken, you will notice that there is a pattern to the story.
There are a number of phrases that repeat and have a similar pattern. This
repetition of words helps your child remember the story and learn the language of
books. After one or more reading, your child will be able to join you as you read the
story.
* Encourage your child to help you to tell the story. Point to the words and have the
child say them with you as you are reading, especially the sections that repeat.
Children feel as if they are reading along too! This will build confidence and your
child will enjoy the predicable repetition.
* If you are listening to the CD version of the story, you can recite along as the
reader repeats phrases that are said over and over again. Or have your child repeat
phrases with you as you read. Some examples of repeat sentences in the story are:
“You made us run from one town to another.”
“You made us run through the fields and into the woods and across the meadows!”
“You made us run up the mountains and down the mountains.
